Regional climate model post-processing repository for ICTP SMR2574 activity

Regional climate: Broad sense to indicate the entire range of spatial scales of less than  ~10 000 km2. 
The task producing reliable regional climate projections is extremely difficult - The regional climate 
change signal is affected by processes that occur at a wide range of spatial scales from planetary to 
the synoptic and mesoscale.

The Regional climate model post-processing repository is a particulary delicate task as the evaluation 
process needs to be carried out at fine spatial scales for which suitable datasets are not always available.
It will thus be important to tap into local ressources and expertise to enhance current observational 
datasets to the extent possible.

Finally, to date, only very few simulations based on RCD tools are available for Africa, so this region
will benefit particulary from the CORDEX framework, from both the research and application points of view.

Second, the output from the RCD simulations will need to be stored in a way that allows easy access to 
the end-user community, likely also requiring standardization of formats (possibly adhering to the CMIP5 format guidelines). This can prove to be a formidable task in view of the large amounts of data produced by fine-scale climate 
models.
